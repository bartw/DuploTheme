# [DuploTheme](https://github.com/bartw/DuploTheme)

A very basic WordPress theme.

I made this theme for my own [Duplo blog](http://beewee.be/duplo/).
This theme has support for a blog page and a single post page.

To install, just copy the files into a new folder under "wordpress/wp-content/themes".
